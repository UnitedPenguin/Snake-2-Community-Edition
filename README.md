In order to create a release:

ALWAYS CHANGE THE CODE ON THE LATEST VERSION IN ORDER TO AVOID OVERWRITING FIXES FROM OLD VERSIONS

First, have the zip downloaded.

Then, use the template: Run the (python file name) file after installing python on the microsoft store, then pasting "pip install pygame" into command line, and also pasting "pip install screeninfo".

Go to releases, click draft a release.

Paste the template and fill it out in the write section.

Upload the .zip to the "attach binaries" box.

Make the title using this scheme:

Ex: v1.0.0

v for version

1 goes up for EXTREME CHANGES (must be approved)

0 is for content updates

0 is for patches

v1.(content update).(patch version)

Based on last update

Goes like this v1.0.0 would go to v1.0.1, but if there was a new content update, it would reset the patch number, extreme update resets patch and content number.

Make a tag with the same name as the release.

Then just create the release.
